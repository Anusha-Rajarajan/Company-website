            Welcome to ASUNA Private Limited!
            ASUNA private limited helps you to purchase very good quality of iphones which are money worthy.
            The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. 
            The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. 
            Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. 
            As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.

            The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. 
            It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and 
            send and receive emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger 
            screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an app store, 
            and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel 
            that returns the user to the home screen.
            <br />
            We hope our company would help you in getting good products from Apple, 
            and we are very greatful to provide you this wondeful service.
